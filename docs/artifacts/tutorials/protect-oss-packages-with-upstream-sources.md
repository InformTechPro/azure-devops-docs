# Tutorial: How to restore packages from upstream sources

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)]

Using upstream sources in Azure Artifacts enables you to manage all your application dependencies from a single feed. It simplifies consuming packages from public registries like *NuGet.org* or *npmjs.com*, while also providing protection against outages or compromised packages. You can also publish your own packages to the same feed and manage all your dependencies in one location.

This tutorial walks you through enabling upstream sources in your feed and consuming packages from public registries such as *NuGet.org* or *npmjs.com*.

## Prerequisites

| **Product**        | **Requirements**   |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Azure DevOps**   | - An Azure DevOps [organization](../../organizations/accounts/create-organization.md).<br>- An Azure DevOps [project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md).<br> - Allow [Azure Artifacts Domain URLs and IP addresses](../../organizations/security/allow-list-ip-url.md) if your organization is using a firewall or a proxy server. |

## Create a feed and enable upstream sources

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select **Artifacts**, and then select **Create Feed** to create a new feed.

1. Provide a **Name** for your feed, choose its **Visibility** and **Scop**, and make sure you check the **Include packages from common public sources** checkbox to enable upstream sources.

1. Select **Create** when you're done.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To add a feed from a different organization as an upstream source, the target feed owner must share the target view with **All feeds and people in organizations associated with my Microsoft Entra tenant** by navigating to **Feed Settings** > **Views** > Select the ellipsis button on the right for the specified view > **Edit** .

## Authenticate with the feed

Now that you've created your feed, select the appropriata tab based on the technology you're using and follow the instructions to set up your configuration file and connect to your feed:

#### [npm](#tab/npm/)

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select **Artifacts**, select your feed from the dropdown menu, and then select **Connect to feed**.

1. Select **npm** from the left navigation pane, and follow the provided instructions in the **Project setup** section to set up your config file. If you donâ€™t already have a *.npmrc* file, create a new one in the root of your project (the same folder as your *package.json*). Open your new *.npmrc* file and paste in the provided snippet.

## Restore packages

Now that you enabled upstream sources and set up your configuration file, you can now run the package restore command to query the upstream source and retrieve the upstream packages.

To restore packages using Azure Pipelines instead, see [Restore Maven packages with Azure Pipelines (YAML/Classic)](../../pipelines/packages/maven-restore.md) for detailed steps.
