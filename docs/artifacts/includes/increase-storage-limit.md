Azure Artifacts provides 2 GiB of free storage for each organization. Once your organization reaches the maximum storage limit, you wonâ€™t be able to publish new artifacts. To continue, you can either delete some of your existing artifacts or increase your storage limit by following these steps:

1. [Set up billing for your organization](../../organizations/billing/set-up-billing-for-your-organization-vs.md#set-up-billing-for-your-organization).

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, select **Organization settings** > **Billing**, and select **No limit, pay for what you use** from the **Usage limit** dropdown.

1. Select **Save** when you're done.
