# About the Azure DevOps Services Demo Generator

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)] 

The Azure DevOps Services Demo Generator is a service which helps you provision projects in your organization with pre-populated sample content that includes source code, work items, iterations, service connections, and build and release pipelines based on a template you choose.

The purpose of this system is to simplify working with the hands-on-labs, demos and other education material provided by the Microsoft Visual Studio Marketing team. You can use it to experiment with different services and options in a personal, pre-configured sandbox, or to simply develop comfort with UI and workflows without impacting a production environment.

To run the Azure DevOps Demo Generator project as a console application or executable, follow the instructions provided in the [configure section](configure.md).
