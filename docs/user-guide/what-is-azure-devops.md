# What is Azure DevOps?

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Azure DevOps supports a collaborative culture and set of processes that bring together developers, project managers, and contributors to build software. It allows organizations to create and improve products at a faster pace than they can with traditional software development approaches.

You can work in the cloud with [Azure DevOps Services](services.md) or on-premises with Azure DevOps Server. For more information, see [Differences between Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server](about-azure-devops-services-tfs.md).

Azure DevOps provides integrated features that you can access through your web browser or IDE client. You can use all the services included with Azure DevOps or choose just what you need to complement your existing workflows.
