> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Deleting **Area Path** values or reconfiguring **Iteration Path** values causes irreversible data loss in the following charts:
>   - Burndown and burnup widget charts
>   - Sprint burndown charts
>   - Velocity charts for teams with changed area paths
>   - Historical trend charts that reference the **Area Path** and **Iteration Path** values as defined at the time for each work item
> - When you delete these paths, you can't retrieve their historical data.
> - You can delete area and iteration paths only when they're no longer used by any work items.
