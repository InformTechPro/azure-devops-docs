## Open Settings > Process

Create, manage, and make customizations to processes from the  **Process** page. 

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{Your_Organization}```).
2. Select :::image type="icon" source="../../../media/icons/gear-icon.png" border="false"::: **Organization settings**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Screenshot shows highlighted Organization settings button.](../../../media/settings/open-admin-settings-vert.png)  

3. Select **Process**. 
   
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Screenshot shows Organization settings, Process page.](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/work/media/process/open-process-page-s150.png) 

	> [!IMPORTANT]  
	> If you don't see **Process**, then you're working from an earlier version where the **Process** page isn't supported. Use the features supported for the [On-premises XML process model](../../../reference/customize-work.md).
