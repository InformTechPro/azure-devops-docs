# View your subscriptions, opt out as needed

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

If you want to stop receiving specific email notifications, you can unsubscribe from the notifications in Azure DevOps. You can opt out of default or built-in subscriptions and unsubscribe from other notifications. For a description of each default subscription, see [Default notifications](oob-built-in-notifications.md).  

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [prerequisites-project-member-only](../../includes/prerequisites-project-member-only.md)]

## View subscriptions

To open your personal notifications, select the **User settings** icon :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/user-settings-gear.png"::: in Azure DevOps, and then select **Notifications** or **Notification settings**:

The **User settings > Notifications** page opens:

Your subscribed notifications show the **State** toggle in the _On_ position, which is colored blue:

Azure DevOps shows the globe icon :::image type="icon" source="media/oob-notification.png"::: for default or out-of-the-box (OOB) subscriptions:

You can't modify an OOB subscription, but you can view its definition from its **More options** menu (**...**).

## Unsubscribe from a notification

To unsubscribe from a notification, slide the **State** toggle to the _Off_ position. The toggle color changes to white and the entire subscription row is grayed:
