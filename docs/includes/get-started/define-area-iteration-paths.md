### Define area and iteration paths for tracking work

If you support several products, you can assign work items according to feature area by defining [area paths](../../organizations/settings/set-area-paths.md). To assign work items to specific time intervals, also known as _sprints_, you configure [iteration paths](../../organizations/settings/set-iteration-paths-sprints.md). To use the Scrum tools like sprint backlogs, taskboards, and team capacity, you need to configure several sprints. For an overview, see [About areas and iteration paths](../../organizations/settings/about-areas-iterations.md).  

The following image shows default iteration paths for Scrum processes:
