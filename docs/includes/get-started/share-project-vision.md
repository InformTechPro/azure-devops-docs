## Share your project vision, set up a project wiki

Each project has a summary page that's useful for sharing information through **README** files. You can also redirect users to a project Wiki. For users who are new to your project, a good approach is to [set up your project summary page](../../organizations/projects/project-vision-status.md) or [prepare a Wiki](../../project/wiki/wiki-create-repo.md). Use these features to share established processes and procedures for your project.
