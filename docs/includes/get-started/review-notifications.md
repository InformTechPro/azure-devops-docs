## Review and update notifications

Several notifications are predefined for each project you add. Notifications are based on subscription rules. Subscriptions arise from the following areas:

- [Out-of-the-box or default subscriptions](../../organizations/notifications/oob-built-in-notifications.md).
- [Team, project, and organization or collection subscriptions](../../organizations/notifications/manage-team-group-global-organization-notifications.md) defined by a team administrator or member of the **Project Administrators** or **Project Collection Administrators** groups. 

If users report receiving too many notifications, you can direct them to [opt out of a subscription](../../organizations/notifications/manage-your-personal-notifications.md).
