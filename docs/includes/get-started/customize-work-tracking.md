### Customize work-tracking processes

You and your team can start using all work-tracking tools immediately after you create a project. But often, some users want to customize the experience to meet various business needs. You can customize the process easily through the user interface. It's a good practice to establish a methodology for which users can manage the updates and evaluate requests.

> [!NOTE]   
> By default, organization owners and users added to the **Project Collection Administrators** security group are granted permission to create, edit, and manage processes used to customize the work-tracking experience. If you want to lock down who is able to perform these tasks, you can set permissions at the organization-level to **Deny**.  

For more information, see the following articles:
