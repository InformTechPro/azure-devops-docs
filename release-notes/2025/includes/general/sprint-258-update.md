### New organizations won't offer public projects

Starting this sprint, new organizations will no longer have the [Allow public projects policy](/azure/devops/organizations/projects/make-project-public?view=azure-devops#1-enable-anonymous-access-to-projects) available. This policy remains unchanged for existing customers. Microsoft recommends using [GitHub](https://github.com/) for all your public project needs.
