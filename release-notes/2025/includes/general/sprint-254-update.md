### No new Azure DevOps OAuth apps beginning April 2025

Starting in April 2025, we're no longer supporting new registrations of Azure DevOps OAuth apps. This is a first step towards our longer-term vision of retiring the Azure DevOps OAuth platform. We reccomend that all developers building applications on top of Azure DevOps REST APIs explore the [Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/v2-overview) and registering a [new Entra application](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app?tabs=certificate%2Cexpose-a-web-api) instead.

All existing Azure DevOps OAuth apps will continue working until the platformâ€™s official retirement in 2026. Learn more in [our blog post here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/no-new-azure-devops-oauth-apps-beginning-february-2025/).

### Server Name Indication (SNI) now mandatory for Azure DevOps Services

Beginning April 23, 2025, we'll require <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication" target="_blank">Server Name Indication (SNI)</a> on all incoming HTTPS connections to Azure DevOps Services.

SNI is an extension to the TLS protocol that allows clients to specify the hostname they're connecting to. All modern browsers and client software support SNI and use it by default, ensuring a seamless transition for most users. In fact, more than 99.995% of the customer traffic reaching our servers is SNI-ready.

However, some client software may be incompatible with SNI due to various factors, such as being outdated, misconfigured networking libraries, runtimes, or operating systems. Issues may also arise from proxies or NGFW firewalls. The following tools used with Azure DevOps may be impacted by SNI issues:

*   Git clients
*   IDE plugins and extensions (Team Explorer Everywhere)
*   Software running on older Java versions which don't support SNI (Java 6 and earlier) or don't have SNI enabled by default (some versions of Java 7 and 8)
*   Old browser versions (see https://caniuse.com/sni)

SNI issues usually manifest by connection errors, such as:

*   ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR , ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID
*   javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException, javax.net.ssl.SSLException
*   Couldn't establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel

You can validate the SNI-compatibility of your system by calling the status endpoint of Azure DevOps, which we have configured to require SNI. If this call is successful, it indicates that the host, including its operating system and networking environment, is SNI-compatible.
