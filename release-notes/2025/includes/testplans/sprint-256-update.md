### View Recent Test Results in Test Case

We’ve added a new “Recent Test Results” section to the test case work item, making it easier to monitor test progress without switching views or navigating through test plans. 

With this update, you can: 

* View the top 4 most recent test results directly from the test case 
* See key details at a glance: outcome, run by, configuration, and completed date 
* Access the full execution history in one click for deeper analysis

These enhancements streamline test review and support requirement-based traceability by keeping execution insights close to where your test cases live. This feature will roll out gradually and become available in the coming weeks. Give it a try, and let us know via [email](mailto:adocustomerfeedback@service.microsoft.com) what you think!
