### Rollup columns data available in backlog

We’ve updated rollup columns to show the most recent available data. Previously, these columns could appear blank for frequently updated work items, causing confusion. You’ll also see a timestamp indicating when the data was last refreshed.

While some delay in Analytics processing is normal, these improvements aim to provide transparency and a smoother experience when working with rollup columns.
