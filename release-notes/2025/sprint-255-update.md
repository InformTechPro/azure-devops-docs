# Expanded security scanning and enhanced GitHub pull request integration with Azure Boards

We’re expanding support in GitHub Advanced Security to include results with URI locations, providing broader coverage from container and dynamic scanning tools.

We’ve also improved how GitHub pull requests connect to Azure Boards work items, making it easier to keep work item states up to date when pull requests are merged.

Check out the release notes for details.
