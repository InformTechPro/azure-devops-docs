# Secret Protection and Code Security plans for Advanced Security 

Following the [GitHub announcement](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-03-04-introducing-github-secret-protection-and-github-code-security/) introducing the GitHub Secret Protection and GitHub Code Security products, we will also be bringing the individual Secret Protection and Code Security products to GitHub Advanced Security on Azure DevOps. 
Any existing customers will not experience any changes to their Advanced Security cost or experiences. New customers after the launch of the individual products will automatically be able to purchase the individual products.
