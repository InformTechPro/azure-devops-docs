# Add trusted root certificates

Managed DevOps Pools is adding support so you can configure your pool to add certificates from your Key Vault as a trusted root certificate to your agents, so you donâ€™t have to add a task for it to all the pipelines that use the pool. For more information, see [Key Vault configuration](/azure/devops/managed-devops-pools/configure-security?view=azure-devops#key-vault-configuration).
