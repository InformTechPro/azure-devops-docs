# Support for JavaScript (Playwright) in Azure Test Plans

Currently it is possible to [associate](/azure/devops/test/associate-automated-test-with-test-case?view=azure-devops) VSTest automated tests to test cases which are part of Test Plans. We are going to expand the list of supported frameworks and allow linking and executing automated tests written in JavaScript (Playwright). The association can be performed directly in Azure DevOps.
