# Enhanced Test Point Result Panel 

This update makes it easier to review test point history by improving the layout, visibility, and interactivity of the test result history panel—so you can find the information you need faster. Here’s what’s new:   

* **Navigation Bar**: A new bar at the top of the panel shows the configuration filter applied to the test case, giving you clear context for the results displayed.   

* **Improved Column Visibility**: We've streamlined the columns to prevent truncation, ensuring important details like configuration and test suite are visible at a glance.  

* **Clickable Rows and Run IDs**: Each row and Run ID is now clickable, letting you jump directly to the full run details in a new tab. 

These enhancements provide a more seamless and informative experience when reviewing test history, helping you track progress and access details with confidence.
