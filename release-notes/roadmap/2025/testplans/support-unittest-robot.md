# Support for Python (UnitTest & Robot) in Azure Test Plans

Currently it is possible to [associate](/azure/devops/test/associate-automated-test-with-test-case?view=azure-devops) VSTest automated tests to test cases which are part of Test Plans. We are going to expand the list of supported frameworks and allow linking and executing automated tests written in Python (UnitTest & Robot). The association can be performed directly in Azure DevOps.
